It would be ideal if the application would just "work" by executing `run-app` similar to how typical Grails applications with the web profile do. In order to achieve that, additional configuration is required.

To support the build process, first we need to add some NPM scripts. Add the following to the `package.json` file.

[source,json]
.src/main/client/package.json
----
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "ng build --prod",
    "buildDev": "ng build",
    "buildWatch": "ng build --watch=true",
  ...
}
----

The next step is to add the https://github.com/srs/gradle-node-plugin[Gradle Node Plugin].

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.moowork.gradle:gradle-node-plugin:1.0.1"
    }
}

apply plugin:"com.moowork.node"
----

Now that we have the plugin, we need to configure it and use it to create some tasks to hook into the build process of the Grails application.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
node {
    version = '6.9.1'
    download = true
    nodeModulesDir = file("src/main/client")
}

task buildClientDev(type: NpmTask, dependsOn: 'npmInstall') {
    group = 'build'
    description = 'Compile client side assets for development'
    args = ['run', 'buildDev']
}

task buildClient(type: NpmTask, dependsOn: 'npmInstall') {
    group = 'build'
    description = 'Compile client side assets for production'
    args = ['run', 'build']
}

task buildClientWatch(type: NpmTask, dependsOn: 'npmInstall') {
    group = 'application'
    description = 'Builds and watches the client side assets for rebuilding'
    args = ['run', 'buildWatch']
}

task clientTest(type: NpmTask, dependsOn: 'npmInstall') {
    group = 'verification'
    description = 'Executes client side unit tests'
    args = ['run', 'test']
}

task clientIntegrationTest(type: NpmTask, dependsOn: 'npmInstall') {
    group = 'verification'
    description = 'Executes client side integration tests'
    args = ['run', 'e2e']
}

bootRun.dependsOn(buildClientDev)

war.dependsOn(buildClient)

test.dependsOn(clientTest)

integrationTest.dependsOn(clientIntegrationTest)

clean {
    delete fileTree(dir: "src/main/webapp")
}
