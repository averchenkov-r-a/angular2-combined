Since a single project is desired, the `settings.gradle` file is no longer necessary.

`rm -f settings.gradle`

Move all of the contents of `server` to the current directory

`mv server/* ./`

Delete the `server` directory

`rm -r server`

Move the `client` directory to the `src/main` directory

`mv client src/main/`

Delete the no longer used `build.gradle` file in the client directory

`rm -f src/main/client/build.gradle`

Now you have a single Grails project with the client side application living in `src/main/client`!
